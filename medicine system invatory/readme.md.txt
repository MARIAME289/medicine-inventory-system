project overview

This project aims to design a relational database for a Medicine Inventory Management System to support key healthcare operations such as managing prescriptions, tracking medicine inventory, and handling patient billing. The system addresses critical issues like prescribing errors, stockouts, and billing discrepancies, which can compromise patient safety. It will store essential information on doctors, patients, diseases, medicines, prescriptions, and bills, enabling efficient data retrieval and analysis—such as identifying the most prescribed medicines or filtering by doctor specialty. Automated triggers will support consistent and accurate billing. Overall, the project showcases how well-structured database systems enhance healthcare reliability and integrity.
